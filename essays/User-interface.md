## Computer Science

When I hear about User interface, I would think about a translator or a adaptor between users and machines. In my perspective, human would not understand how the machines work unless they have put a lot of effort to learn already. We usually do not perform behaviors like what machines or computers do because we were born in different "system". Therefore, when we want to communicate with someone/something in different system, a interface is required for both sides. I like the idea, UI frameworks can be almost as complicated to learn as a new programming language, which is taken from my ICS 314 course. It made me think about that interfaces and languages both have the concept of communication and interaction. If the interface are able to translate users' command with their own natural languages, it would reduce time consumption for learning how to use the UI. I believe learning how to use a UI is inevitable for programmers which can significantly improve efficiency while developing anything in the field of computer science.

## Experience with Semantic UI

In the Spring of 2021, I learned how to use Semantic UI to create a website. It was helpful because I could use the components which were provided, rather than just creating one from myself. The buttons and the icons are the simple examples and they are easy to implement as well. One thing that bothered me is there was no explanation and warning when conflicts occured. Sometimes, I added some classes to the html file and made some changes to the css file, and ended with no change. It was frustrated when I had no idea to do the trial-and-error. I remembered that I set the color to white in my css file and the font color kept remaining black in my UI Frameworks WOD, and I failed the WOD eventually. While the website are becoming more complicated, the modifications are becoming harder due to potential conflicts between components. I do appreciate that a lot of building blocks that are provided for usage when we are creating the website. However, mastering how to manipulate them is essential to improve efficiency, otherwise, I guess more time could be consumed.

"[I]f you can only implement one software engineering technique to improve quality, it should be coding standards." I copied with sentence from my ICS 314 course because the idea of standards could also apply to the computer science. By following the coding standards, teammates could take less time on understand what you did in the program/project and more easy to cooperate with you. The efficency might be one of the important things in software development process. My experience of integrated development environments was IntelliJ, and ESLint was used in my ICS 314 for implementing coding standards. It was not painful for me since the errors were easy to fix, but still curious about how the coding standards were made and decided.
