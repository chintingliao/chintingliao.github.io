## Computer Science

When I hear about User interface, I would think about a translator or a adaptor between users and machines. In my perspective, human would not understand how the machines work unless they have put a lot of effort to learn already. We usually do not perform behaviors like what machines or computers do because we were born in different "system". Therefore, when we want to communicate with someone/something in different system, a interface is required for both sides. I like the idea, UI frameworks can be almost as complicated to learn as a new programming language, which is taken from my ICS 311 course. It made me think about that interfaces and languages both have the concept of communication and interaction. If the interface are able to translate users' command with their own natural languages, it would reduce time consumption for learning how to use the UI. I believe learning how to use a UI is inevitable for programmers which can significantly improve efficiency while developing anything in the field of computer science.

## Experience with Semantic UI

As I mentioned above, I feel standards usually are associated with certain degree of pressure. I have to follow the standards to acquire what I asked for. It is reasonable if I think I need to pay something to get something I want. However, the willingness is my major concern about the paying. I believe sometimes people are not able to refuse the cost since there is no other option. The advantage of standards is things are going to be more easy to recognize and communicate, and the benefits are less time cosumption and less conflict. Since standards are more strict, people can efficiently work together and even do something more advanced. Language is one thing I can think of standards. If I don't follow the standards of a particular language, other people might not able to understand my work and communicate with me. It is terrible and what we want to avoid when we are in teamwork. However, the creativity might be lost via being compliant. Besides, the standards are not friendly to someone is new to the field, which makes me think about the stressfulness when people need to learn the second language.

"[I]f you can only implement one software engineering technique to improve quality, it should be coding standards." I copied with sentence from my ICS 314 course because the idea of standards could also apply to the computer science. By following the coding standards, teammates could take less time on understand what you did in the program/project and more easy to cooperate with you. The efficency might be one of the important things in software development process. My experience of integrated development environments was IntelliJ, and ESLint was used in my ICS 314 for implementing coding standards. It was not painful for me since the errors were easy to fix, but still curious about how the coding standards were made and decided.
