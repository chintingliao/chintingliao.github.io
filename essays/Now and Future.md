## Computer Science

Currently, I am not Computer Science major, but I used to be. After graduated from middle school(junior high school), I chose to study in the 5-years college and major in information management, rather than choose the typical path of going to high school(senior high school). I learned Visual Basic and Java there, and graduated at June, 2015. Therefore, I have AS degree of IM. However, I faild to enter the normal 4-year-unversity after graduation. Therefore, I somehow lost the direction of job seeking, and started to search any other field that can interest me; Biology was the answer I got.

## Molecular Cell Biology

I always interested in how the world works. Computer Science is one of the world that interests me, but so do the real world. At the beginning, I was thinking that human will eventually get into the virtual world in the future, so Computer Science should be the field that should not declined. However, I doubted that human must deal with the biological entity before getting into the virtual world. Biology become my current major that I believe will be very useful in the near future. As a result, I chose Molecular Cell Biology for extending my point of view.


## The foolproof way to get ignored.

While there are decent questions that benefit everyone, there are those one can ask to create an entirely different effect. In the following example, a user asks how he would, in short, create a desktop application with Facebook.

```
Q: Facebook Desktop Notifier

I am a beginner programmer that have never used anything other than what's included in a language.

I am trying to create a desktop application that notifies me anytime I get an update onfacebook. 
How should go about doing this? Thanks in advance.

edit Sorry I was not clear. Is there any way to make a DESKTOP application with facebook?
```

A simple “yes” would have answered the question, but we know that’s not the sort of answer he or she is looking for. Fortunately, someone kindly responded with a link to Facebook’s developer website. The asker should have done more research on his or her potential project. Then further down the road, he or she could have asked more specific and detailed questions that wouldn’t require a thousand-paged response for a sufficient answer.

## Conclusion

When we rely on others’ generosity and expertise to provide answers to our questions, it should hold that the question we ask should be one that leads to efficient and effective help that not only benefits us, but also the people we ask and others who might ask the same question in the future. Thus, if you have a question… make it a smart one! Asking questions may not always get you the best answer, but asking them in a way that will make others want to answer them will increase the success of finding a good solution and make it a positive experience on all sides.
