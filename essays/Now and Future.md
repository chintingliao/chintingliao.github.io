## Computer Science

Currently, I am not Computer Science major, but I used to be. After graduated from middle school(junior high school), I chose to study in the 5-years college and major in information management, rather than choose the typical path of going to high school(senior high school). I learned Visual Basic and Java there, and graduated at June, 2015. Therefore, I have AS degree of IM. However, I faild to enter the normal 4-year-unversity after graduation. Therefore, I somehow lost the direction of job seeking, and started to search any other field that can interest me; Biology was the answer I got.

## Molecular Cell Biology

I always interested in how the world works. Computer Science is one of the world that interests me, but so do the real world. At the beginning, I was thinking that human will eventually get into the virtual world in the future, so Computer Science should be the field that should not declined. However, I doubted that human must deal with the biological entity before getting into the virtual world. Biology become my current major that I believe will be very useful in the near future. As a result, I chose Molecular Cell Biology for extending my point of view.


## Interests and Jobs

I still think Computer Science is important due to the human evolution. Human have biological life limit, so seeking for longer life span is inevitable. I assume Computer Science will play a significant role in the future because of human nature. Therefore, this is one of the reason I still taking ICS class for acquring knowledge and skills; despite I am Molecular Cell Biology major. In addition, almost all the fields cannot avoid introducing information technology in the future, even now. The world would change faster and faster, so how to survive in the continuously changing world will be the critical issue for people to solve. Personally, I want to take advantage of everything I learned from ICS courses to support my persecptive in the biological field. 

Molecular Cell Biology is the field focus on the molecular scale of living stuffs, and physiology as well. Many diseases cause many issues which could impact the whold world, especially nobody will refuse the idea since we are experiencing the pandemic. Most of the fields had negative impact during the COVID period. However, Biological field seems to develop faster than the past due to the development of vaccine and invention of treament and prevention. The pandemic gives me some confidence of chosing the correct field to study because people in the biological field are showing their value to the society and the importance of Biology in the future. I do believe both Molecular Cell Biology and Computer Science will become more prosperous in the future, and they are my interests, too. My goal is finding a job that I can combine the knowledge and skills from both areas.
