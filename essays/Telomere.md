## Cancer Biology

In Spring 2021, I took the Cancer Biology course and had further understanding about the relationships between cancer and telomere. 

## Aging

Recent years, it is believed that telomere length may be corelated to the longevity. However, The lengths of telomere are varied between species. The activities of the enzyme, telomerase, which is silenced in adult cells but active in fetal cells, are also varied between species as well. Therefore, the longer of the lengths of telomeres does not indicate the longer lifespan generally. For instance, mice have longer telomeres (25-150 kb) compared with humans (15-20 kb) (Gomes et al., 2011). Moreover, mouse telomeres shorten ∼100 times faster than human telomeres (Vera et al., 2012), which makes the lengths of telomere not directly corelated to life span. Interestingly, the telomerase is active constitutively in most mice cells, which suggests that the results we examined from mice might not be necessarily observed in human.
