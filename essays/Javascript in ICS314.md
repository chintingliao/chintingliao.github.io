I take ICS314 for Software Engineering at UH Manoa in Spring, 2021. In this semester, I choose the course for two reasons. One is I need the upper division WI for graduation, and the other is I still don't want to give up my Computer Science skills.I think Javascript have many similarities with Java, which I have learned in ICS 111 and ICS 211. The difference is Java use System.out.print, but Javascript use console.log. This is the only thing I recognize so far, but I assume the differences will increase in the rest of the semester. In addition, Javascript is more easy to use because I don't need to install anything additionally, which always comforts me for no extra work. However, the bug is hard to find due to the relatively small outcome displayment. I still cannot find a way to expand the console(beta) area.

Currently, I don't have any idea about that Javascript is good or bad programming language. Maybe the reason is I am unfamilier to any kind of programming languages. The last time I took ICS class is a year ago, and it is for Algorithm. Therefore, I kind of forgot how to code with Java, C, and C++, which I learned two years ago. Javascript looks very new to me, so I spent extra time on the FreeCodeCamp for recalling my memory.

There is a special thing called WODs, which are used to train the ICS314 students to complete a program within several minutes. This is a bit stressful because I didn't have any experience about time-limited programming. In the past, it is fine for me to think about how to write codes for particular programs for hours. However, I heard about these time-limited challenges will the present in the future interviews. Therefore, I accept the challenges since they make sense to me;despite I don't really like them. Moreover, I do believe students can take advantage from the challenges and have better performance in the work place. For me, I wish I can do it and I will try my best.
