## How to ask

Communication is always a critical issue for me since I feel uncomfortable about talking to strangers. Therefore, I usually didn't ask questions because I didn't want people to ask me questions. However, asking questions via typing messages is one way that I could feel stressless due to I can modify the questions before sending or passing. Fortunately, I read an essay written by Eric Raymond called How to ask questions the smart way recently, and I felt this essay is very helpful for me to pay more attention on question asking. I believe that people sometimes ask inappropriate questions which could lead to bad consequences happen, such as time wasting and no progress. Therefore, learning how to ask "smart" questions is the way to acquire effectiveness.

## Interesting tips

I always interested in how the world works. Computer Science is one of the world that interests me, but so do the real world. At the beginning, I was thinking that human will eventually get into the virtual world in the future, so Computer Science should be the field that should not declined. However, I doubted that human must deal with the biological entity before getting into the virtual world. Biology become my current major that I believe will be very useful in the near future. As a result, I chose Molecular Cell Biology for extending my point of view.
