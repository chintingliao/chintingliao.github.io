## Obey and Comply with rules/standards/norms

Rules are present in every corner, and sometimes we can choose whether to obey or not. However, I am not exactly sure about how to distinguish rules, standards and norms in English, so maybe I need to define them further. Personally, I feel rules usually let me have some kind of understanding, and I can have a sense of why I need to obey. However, standards are more strict and sometimes hard to question about why. For norms, they are more associated with what people think about being normal. Back to the topic, I am more likely to obey rules since they are more understandable for me; norms are more flexible for obedience; standards are usually the one that make me feel forced.

## Pros and Cons of Standards

As I mentioned above, I feel standards usually are associated with certain degree of pressure. I have to follow the standards to acquire what I asked for. It is reasonable if I think I need to pay something to get something I want. However, the willingness is my major concern about the paying. I believe sometimes people are not able to refuse the cost since there is no other option. The advantage of standards is things are going to be more easy to recognize and communicate, and the benefits are less time cosumption and less conflict. Since standards are more strict, people can efficiently work together and even do something more advanced. Language is one thing I can think of standards. If I don't follow the standards of a particular language, other people might not able to understand my work and communicate with me. It is terrible and what we want to avoid when we are in teamwork. However, the creativity might be lost via being compliant. Besides, the standards are not friendly to someone is new to the field, which makes me think about the stressfulness when people need to learn the second language. 

## Computer Science 

In the essay, posting homework questions is one of things we should avoid. It is the ["stupid" question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23170022/summing-the-number-to-the-specified-value) that I found in the stackoverflow website. The question basically copy/paste the assignment or interview questions and ask for help. The comments showed that people don't seems to willing to help. One of them even asked "where is the question?".
There is the other question which I consider a ["smart question"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/237104/how-do-i-check-if-an-array-includes-a-value-in-javascript) that I found in the stackoverflow website. This question is clear enough, and it showed the attitude of the questioner. Because the questioner provided the code that s/he came out to be his/her only way to solve the problem, the other people could provide different way to achieve the same outcome.
